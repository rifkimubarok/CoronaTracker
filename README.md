# CoronaTracker

CoronaTracker is a free, open-sourced, online app for tracking COVID-19 outbreak cases based on countries. All data of this app has provided by [Microsoft's Bing](https://bing.com/covid) and will be updated daily.

Apple won't approve any coronavirus-themed app created by individual developers, so I open-sourced this app and you can install on your physical phone and use it.
